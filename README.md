# PFI Github Introduction
This is a repo to demonstrate how to set up github with Eclipse and IntelliJ for MED2 Programming For Interaction (Programmering af Interaktive Systemer)

## Git Client
I recommend both having a command-line and GUI interface for working with Git.
* Git can be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/. This gives you a basic GUI client and a Git Bash, a powerful Command line tool for git.
    * I recommend **NOT** using vim, but chosing a different text editor. Personally I would recommend [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) though any fast plain text editor is good
* In adition to Git, you will want a git client. 
    * [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a simple solution, but again I would recommend against it, as it is lacking in features. 
    * [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is better, but needs to be set up initially with BitBucket and an Attlassian account, and then integrated.
    * [GitKracken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) is a good client, but many of its better features require a paid account.
    * [**Fork**](https://git-fork.com/) is a feature rich client with a simple interface. This gets my recommendation.
    
## Setting up a Repository
You can create repositories through your command line, your Git Client, or on Github. For simplicity sake, I recommend creating the repository on Github first.

1. Create a new repository, and give it a short but descriptive name.
    * I like to have a README file for documentation, though it is not necessary.
    * You can find a premade Java gitignore, but this doesn't have everything that you want.
2. Either add the .gitignore file from this repo, or edit your .gitignore to include the following lines:
```
# Eclipse
.classpath
.project
.settings/

# Intellij
.idea/
*.iml
*.iws

# Mac
.DS_Store

# Maven
log/
target/
```

### .gitignore
As the name suggests, this file tells git what files to ignore.
Many files will be generated by your IDE (i.e. Eclipse or IntelliJ) or by Java when comiling and running your projects. 
These files do not need to be tracked by Git, as they will be automatically generated if they cannot be found.
As such, in order to keep your repository small and tidy, we ignore these files.
Likewise you may want to add files such as .png, .mp4 etc. if you have large texture or audio files, as they may be too large to upload to Github. 
* Git LFS exists for handling Large Files, though this has a tight storage limit on the free plan, and is somewhat complicated to manage. I will not go into it here, but it is worth knowing that it exists if you need it.
